# FolderDesk by iMPLEMENTAi — Your Business AI Operating System

FolderDesk gives a capable AI agent a **durable business workspace**: active work, reusable knowledge, finished outputs, filing/retrieval, repeatable Skills and a small amount of hidden operating support.

**You do not need GitHub experience to use FolderDesk.** GitHub is the durable backend. The normal client experience is: give FolderDesk to an authorised agent, let the agent establish the workspace, connect the systems that matter, and start useful work.

**Fast links:** **[Ultimate Features](FEATURES.md)** · [Get Started](BOOTSTRAP.md) · [Architecture](ARCHITECTURE.md) · [Verify](VERIFY.md) · [Safe Harbour](MANIFEST.md) · [Releases](RELEASES.md) · [Agent Router](AGENTS.md)

## Start here — Give this to your AI agent

```text
https://github.com/tbhrc/folderdesk
Fork this repository into my authorised GitHub organisation or account and run BOOTSTRAP.md from the fork.
```

That is the entire handoff prompt. The repository owns the deployment instructions; the agent should then follow [BOOTSTRAP.md](BOOTSTRAP.md).

## What you get

- one simple workspace for active work, knowledge, outputs and archive;
- six self-contained local Skills for structure, capability building, learning, lightweight auditing, document intake and client experience;
- durable task/work continuity when continuity is useful, without making Issues an approval gate;
- filing and retrieval of documents instead of read-once chat handling;
- organisational memory tied back to source documents and real owner systems;
- connection to the business systems you already use, while those systems remain authoritative for their own live records;
- polished business outputs through the appropriate document/output tools;
- optional expansion to more repositories, specialist systems, runtimes or advanced capabilities only when demonstrated need earns them.

## Internal OS boundary

This repository is the **public/client deployable FolderDesk distribution**, not the private internal operating-system source.

- Internal first-class system: **FolderDesk AI Business Operating System (FolderDesk OS)** in private `tbhrc/folderdesk-os`.
- This repository contains the deliberately productised/deployable subset suitable for client/public distribution.
- FolderDesk Tiny / FD Tiny is the smallest deployment variant within the public distribution lineage.
- Internal state, private integrations and enterprise-specific machinery are not copied here automatically.

## Advanced/reference capability

GitHub provides a much larger platform capability layer—identity/access, search, secrets, Apps/OAuth, APIs, automation, auditability and more. That inventory is useful for architecture and product development, but it is **not a first-day FolderDesk requirement**. See [GitHub Platform Capabilities](GITHUB-PLATFORM-CAPABILITIES.md) when a real deployment need calls for it.

## For operators

Technical deployment, verification, recovery and CLI guidance live in [BOOTSTRAP.md](BOOTSTRAP.md), [ATLAS.md](ATLAS.md), [VERIFY.md](VERIFY.md) and the root [AGENTS.md](AGENTS.md).
