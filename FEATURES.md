# FolderDesk Capability Catalogue

**Status:** Current FolderDesk v2 product/reference capability map  
**Product owner:** [`tbhrc/folderdesk`](https://github.com/tbhrc/folderdesk)

## Product baseline

FolderDesk v2 is a **single-repository-first, file-native human + AI operating workspace**. A new deployment starts with one useful workspace repository, normal human folders (`work/`, `knowledge/`, `outputs/`, `archive/`) and agent support under `.folderdesk/`. Domains are local context/folder concerns by default. Additional repositories are optional expansion and must earn their boundary.

A fresh FolderDesk-managed workspace is self-contained. It includes six progressive-loaded local Skills: `structure`, `skill-builder`, `lessons`, `auditor`, `document-intake` and `client-experience`.

Live mutable truth stays with the correct owner. FolderDesk connects CRM, accounting, file stores, databases, calendars, memory and specialist runtimes rather than copying them into a competing source of truth.

### Internal OS / FolderDesk Agents boundary

This file is the **public FolderDesk distribution capability catalogue**, not the private FolderDesk OS capability registry.

The private full system is [`tbhrc/folderdesk-os`](https://github.com/tbhrc/folderdesk-os). **FolderDesk Agents** names the agent/harness layer inside the wider architecture; TBHRC organisational role profiles remain in Workspace `.folderdesk/agents/` and are not copied into this public distribution automatically. Public FolderDesk productises only proven, client-safe agent-support capability deliberately.

### Scope labels

- **Core** — directly implemented by FolderDesk v2.
- **Reference** — proven in the TBHRC/iMPLEMENTAi ecosystem and reusable when the relevant owner/capability is connected.
- **Connected** — supplied by an authorised external platform, connector, runtime or specialist system.

## Expansion capabilities

These are available when real operating evidence warrants them; they are **not default bootstrap requirements**.

| Capability | Scope | When to use it |
|---|---|---|
| Separate Skills repository | Reference | Reusable HOW has a real independent owner/lifecycle |
| Separate Research repository | Reference | Research volume/ownership has matured beyond local workspace needs |
| Separate product/runtime repository | Reference | Independent release, access, execution or operational lifecycle |
| Multi-agent orchestration | Reference | Genuine parallel specialist work materially improves the outcome |
| Cross-repository routing | Reference | The organisation already has or has earned a multi-repo estate |
| Universal database / transactional stores | Connected/Reference | Identity, transactions, joins, concurrency or query guarantees exceed file semantics |
| Scheduled/conditional automation | Connected | Recurring or event-driven work requires persistent execution |
| File/folder ingestion loops | Reference | Large estates need deterministic inventory, delta detection and provenance |
| Hindsight/shared memory | Reference | Cross-session derived recall adds value without replacing canonical owner truth |
| VPS/local/self-hosted runtime | Connected | A capability genuinely requires privileged/local execution |
| Research escalation / technology radar | Reference | Repeated local friction indicates a broader platform/tool decision worth proving |
| MCP ingress / external deployment service | Future/Connected | Native agent + GitHub deployment proves insufficient for a real client entry path |
| Large GitHub platform capability inventory | Reference | Architecture/product research needs it; never a first-day runtime requirement |

## Expansion test

A second repository should normally have at least one concrete reason:

- materially different ownership or access boundary;
- privacy/security separation;
- independent release/lifecycle;
- genuine concurrency or isolated execution need;
- public distribution separate from private work;
- mature reusable capability whose separate ownership is demonstrably simpler.

Several departments alone is **not** a reason to create several repositories.

## Current deployment commands

```bash
python3 scripts/folderdesk.py onboard --output folderdesk.json
python3 scripts/folderdesk.py doctor --config folderdesk.json --connectors
python3 scripts/folderdesk.py plan --config folderdesk.json --inspect-target
python3 scripts/folderdesk.py bootstrap --config folderdesk.json --apply
python3 scripts/folderdesk.py verify --config folderdesk.json
python3 scripts/folderdesk.py export --config folderdesk.json --output folderdesk-estate.json --inspect-target
```

A fresh successful `bootstrap --apply` creates the workspace **and** seeds the six core local Skills. `scripts/seed_foundation.py --apply` remains an adoption/repair tool for existing workspaces and creates only missing Skill files.

## Deliberate non-features

- Forced repository-per-domain topology.
- Mandatory separate Skills, Research or Operations repositories for a new client.
- Mandatory Issue-per-task or audit-before-execution lifecycle.
- Recurring audit service, audit ledger, approval state or scorecard as product baseline.
- Monolithic all-in-one agent runtime.
- Duplicate canonical memory layer.
- Replacing specialist systems merely to make the estate look uniform.
- Databases, queues, vector stores or services before a demonstrated requirement earns them.
- Artificial capability-count targets as a deployment acceptance criterion.

## Product principle

> **Start with one useful workspace. Expand only from demonstrated need. The operating system must not become the work.**
